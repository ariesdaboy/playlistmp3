# playlistmp3
A simple Python + HTML + CSS + Flask website with a playlist creator that supports mp3 links. 

Developed by ariesDev

         

You can create your own playlist using mp3 links that you can get in palcomp3.com.br, instead of downloading your music from there, get a hyperlink with a ".mp3" in the final, then put in our "Nova MÃºsica" form and enjoy listening :) 

For getting the hyperlink you should first pick any music that you want to hear and in the download symbol you will right click and copy the URL, and it's done, just paste in our "link" area in our form and enjoy your music playing in the website, you can add as many as you want.

Any questions please contact me! This is just a small project and i learned a lot about it with @codethi  =)
